# password-generator-challenge-3-mm
I am currently having issues pushing to upload to git hub so i am going to make notes as i add stuff and put notes in of what time it happens.

10:32pm inital commit tried a test push
10:44pm built all the var letters, numbers and possible characters, left certain characters out in order to not get confused with others
10:49pm went back and added camel case to the Var.
11:46pm Finished the if else portion 
12:05am Finished the Selected group portion. 
12:16am having issues with it accepting the return coding and cant get it to recognize possible characters 

Got github issues figured out. Had to rebase but everything is good and pushing now. Had a git repository in the projects folder instead of my actual challenge folder.

This challenge was to create a password generator which the user would be able to a list of options. These options include :Password length between 8-128 characters, along with if they wanted lowercase letters, Uppercase letters, Numbers, And special characters.
